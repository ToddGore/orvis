# Interview Packet

## Thank you!

First, I want to reach out and thank you for applying for a web development position at Orvis! Good luck as you accomplish the tasks below. This code base will be the basis of our conversation from this point on in the interview process.

## Overview of the tasks

As you get started there are some instructions to follow:

- Use the spec sheet in the comps folder for details you may need, if there is something missing feel free to email questions.
- We don't need you to spend more than 3hrs on the test, your are not restricted to a certain time slot if you finish soon then great, but we know you are busy, so don't go crazy.
- to submit the test, you can zip it up and email it to use, or use a service like github, bitbucket, gitlab, dropbox or similar and send us a URL. We just need to be able to run it!

In the Folder there are several assets that are needed for different tasks. There is text to enter and images to use. We are not worried about which images go where, or what text is used. In fact, if you need one, http://dustinsenos.com/littleIpsum, is a great lorem ipsum generator for the mac and all the images are from unsplash. The font used, open sans, is a google font that you can find here: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans.

Please keep in mind as you are coding these tasks that we continuously think about maintainability, sharability, and footprint. Initial load as well as overall page size is important.

### The Task

There are four comps in the comps folder that represent different design patterns, we want you to build some of them. Don't be nervous, just relax and code and have fun. Some of the tasks are harder than others, if you don't complete them it is ok, just give us what you can. Please complete the two tasks below.

#### Task 1: The article

- **Article** is located here: comps/article.jpg
- Code it up.
- use the images in the in images folder, keep in mind performance and footprint.

#### Task 2: Pick your task

- pick one of these:
    - **Tile**: comps/tile.jpg
    - **Tiles**: comps/tiles.jpg
    - **masonry**: comps/masonry.jpg
- Code it up
- if you choose masonry, use the JSON provided.
- We'll ask you why you chose the one you did.

## Good Luck!
